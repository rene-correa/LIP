# LIP - Linguagens de Programção
This repo is a representation of every code done in Programming Languages class, presented on the Post-Degree course of Embedded Systems at Senai-SP ministrated by Professor Canno. 

### Disclaimer
- All codes here will be done in C or C++ with some explanation about them.
- Here we will have also basic projects of Arduino, done with Platform.io and used to put in practice the knowledge aquired in a microctonroller of type AVR. The arduino language shall not be used, but there might be some exceptions. 
- Feel free to use or make any sugestions to any code presented here.
